				Multiplayer Shooty Game
			</h1>
			<p>
				Originally, this was going to be a sort of tf2 inspired game with classes and quick matches. The idea behind the game has changed so many times since then. Every time I wanted to work on a new project, such as a tank simulator or an airplane, I just invisioned a way to merge it into MSG. It's now becoming a sort of blend between ravenfield and dcs. The freedom that dcs has to offer with the customizability of ravenfield. idk if it'll ever get finished, scope creep's real bro
				<br>
				I've been inspired by countless games over the years and I'd like to combine all the best parts into something that <em>I</em> would have fun with. I don't want to have the complexity of DCS in order to play with friends who aren't into learning a plane completely, but I don't want it to be as simple as say project reality. A VTOL VR or Derail Valley -like experience in terms of complexity seems perfect.
