			<p>
				it turns out, this doesnt exist because i dont understand how to get unity games to function on github pages!

				this is a game i made in about an hour or two while in science class. its called squareplane because i thought its funny because the game was modelled off of was cube ground or something similar. it's not what i would call good but its kinda fun i suppose i guess
